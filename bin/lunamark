# NAME

lunamark - converts markdown to many formats

# SYNOPSIS

lunamark [options] [file..]

# DESCRIPTION

Lunamark is a lua library and command-line program for conversion of markdown
to other textual formats. Currently HTML, Docbook, ConTeXt, LaTeX, and Groff man
are the supported output formats, but it is easy to add new writers or modify
existing ones. The markdown parser is written using a PEG grammar and can also
be modified by the user.

Lunamark's markdown parser currently supports the following extensions (which
can be turned on or off individually):

  - Smart typography (fancy quotes, dashes, ellipses)
  - Significant start numbers in ordered lists
  - Footnotes (both regular and inline)
  - Definition lists
  - Metadata
  - Pandoc title blocks
  - Pandoc citations
  - Fenced code blocks

More extensions will be supported in later versions.

The library is as portable as lua and has very good performance.
It is slightly faster than the author's own C library
[peg-markdown](http://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown).

# OPTIONS

`--to,-t` *format*
:   Specify format for output.
    *format* can be `html`, `html5`, `dzslides`, `docbook`, `latex`, `context`, or `man`.
`--layout,-l` *layout*
:   Control whitespace in output.
    *layout* can be `default` (blank lines between block-level elements),
    `compact` (avoid unnecessary blank lines), or `minimize` (avoid
    all unnecessary space).
`--extensions,-X` *extensions*
:   Use the specified syntax extensions in parsing markdown.
    *extensions* is a comma-separated list of extensions, each optionally
    prefixed with `-` (disable), `+` (enable), or followed by
    `=parameter` (enable and parametrize).  See EXTENSIONS, below, for
    a list of supported extensions.  The keyword 'all' may also be
    used, to set all extensions simultaneously.
`--output,-o` *file*
:   Write output to *file*.
`--standalone,-s`
:   Add header and footer to the document, so that it is a functional
    standalone document, not a fragment.  Use the default template
    for the writer, unless `--template,-T` is used.
`--template,-T` *file*
:   Insert converted text and metadata into a template.  See TEMPLATES,
    below, for template format.  Implies `--standalone,-s`.
`--data,-d` *key=value[,key=value..]*
:   Set metadata fields to be passed to template.  Argument is a list
    of *key=value* pairs, separated by commas.  If keys are repeated,
    an array value will be formed.
`--strict,-0`
:   Disable all markdown extensions.
`--version,-V`
:   Print version information.
`--help,-h`
:   This message

# EXTENSIONS

The following extensions are defined, with the default setting given in
parentheses.  The defaults can be changed locally by defining an
environment variable `LUNAMARK_EXTENSIONS` (see ENVIRONMENT below).

`(-) containers`
:   Put sections in containers (`div` tags for `html` writer,
    `section` tags for `html5` or `dzslides`).

`(-) slides`
:   Like `containers`, but do not allow containers to nest.
    The container for a section will end before the container for
    a subsection begins.  This is usually what is wanted
    for HTML5 slide shows (and is selected by default for `dzslides`).

`(-) startnum`
:   Start number of an ordered list is significant. In standard
    markdown, the starting number is irrelevant.  If this
    extension is selected, the starting number determines
    the starting number of the list in the output.  (The
    subsequent numbers are ignored, as in standard markdown.)

`(-) smart`
:   Smart typography. Straight quotes are turned into curly
    quotes, `--` into en dashes, `---` into em dashes, `...`
    into an ellipsis character.

`(-) preserve_tabs`
:   Don't expand tabs to spaces. Standard markdown expands all
    tabs, using a tabstop of 4 spaces.  This extension allows
    tabs to be preserved in literal code contexts.

`(-) notes`
:   Footnotes. A footnote marker is like a markdown bracketed
    reference, but beginning with a circumflex (`^`).  The note
    itself goes in a separate block, which begins with the marker,
    followed by a colon and space, and ends with a blank line.
    The note can contain multiple paragraphs or other block elements,
    but each block must be indented four spaces. Example:

        Here is a note.[^mynote]

        [^mynote]: This note has two paragraphs.

            Here is the second one.

`(-) inline_notes`
:   Inline footnotes. An inline footnote is like a markdown bracketed
    reference, but preceded with a circumflex (`^`). Example:

        Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write,
        since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to
        type the note.]

`(-) definition_lists`
:   Definition lists.  A list item consists of a term, on a single
    line, followed by one or more definitions.  Each definition
    begins with a colon (`:`), but is otherwise indented four spaces.
    A definition may contain multiple block elements.  The colon
    need not be flush-left, but may be preceded by one or two spaces.
    Alternatively, a tilde (`~`) may be used instead of a colon.
    Example:

        rake
        :   a tool for gathering leaves.

            (paragraph two of definition one.)

        :   a ruby build system.

`(-) citations`
:   Pandoc citations. Citations go inside square brackets and are
    separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed
    of `@` + the citation identifier from the database, and may
    optionally have a prenote, and a postnote. The citation key must
    begin with a letter, digit, or `_`, and may contain alphanumerics,
    `_`, and internal punctuation characters (`:.#$%&-+?<>~/`).
    Examples:

        Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, chap. 1].

        Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

        Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].

    A minus sign (`-`) before the `@` will suppress mention of the
    author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is
    already mentioned in the text:

        Smith says blah [-@smith04].

    You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

        @smith04 says blah.

        @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.

    Some writers will accept finer-grained configuration of the
    citations extension via `-X citations=configuration`.

`(+) citation_nbsps`
:   Convert any spacing in citation prenotes and postnotes into
    non-breaking spaces.

`(-) fenced_code_blocks`
:   Fenced code blocks. A code fence is a sequence of at least three
    consecutive backtick characters (`) or tildes (~). (Tildes and
    backticks cannot be mixed.) A fenced code block begins with a code
    fence, indented no more than three spaces. The line with the
    opening code fence may optionally contain some text following the
    code fence; this is trimmed of leading and trailing spaces and
    called the info string. The info string may not contain any
    backtick characters.

    The content of the code block consists of all subsequent lines,
    until a closing code fence of the same type as the code block
    began with (backticks or tildes), and with at least as many
    backticks or tildes as the opening code fence. If the leading code
    fence is indented N spaces, then up to N spaces of indentation are
    removed from each line of the content (if present). (If a content
    line is not indented, it is preserved unchanged. If it is indented
    less than N spaces, all of the indentation is removed.)

    The closing code fence may be indented up to three spaces, and may
    be followed only by spaces, which are ignored. Example:

        ``` lua
        local function fac(n)
          if n <= 0
            return 1
          else
            return n * fac(n)
          end
        end
        ```````

`(-) lua_metadata`
:   Lua metadata.  An HTML comment beginning `<!--@` and containing
    lua variable declarations is treated as metadata.  Note that strings
    are read literally unless they are explicitly marked as markdown
    using the `markdown` (or `m`) function. Lua metadata can occur anywhere
    in a document. Example:

        <!--@
        title = m"My title with *italics*"
        abstract = m[[
          This is my abstract.

          * point one
          * point two
          ]]
        author = { "Me", "You" }
        -->

`(-) pandoc_title_blocks`
:   Pandoc style title blocks at the beginning of a document:

        % Title
        % Author1; Author2
        % Date

        content starts here...

`(-) require_blank_before_blockquote`
:   Require a blank line between a paragraph and a following blockquote.

`(-) require_blank_before_header`
:   Require a blank line between a paragraph and a following header.

`(-) require_blank_before_fenced_code_block`
:   Require a blank line between a paragraph and a following fenced
    code block.

`(-) hash_enumerators`
:   Allow `#` instead of a digit for an ordered list enumerator
    (equivalent to `1`).

`(-) task_list`
:   GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) task list extension to standard
    bullet lists. Items starting with `[ ]`, `[x]` or `[X]` after the
    bullet are processed as first-class structures by the Markdown reader
    when this option is enabled, possibly allowing writers to handle
    them more efficiently with a finer-grain logic.

`(-) fancy_lists`
:   Allow ordered list items to use a roman number or a letter
    as anumerator, instead of a digit, and to use a closing parenthesis
    as end delimiter, instead of a period.

    Depending on the selected writer, the numbering scheme and delimeter
    may be honored or just ignored.

    If the `startnum` option is enabled, the starting value is converted
    to decimal, when necessary, so that the list at least starts at the
    appropriate value.

    So in the minimal case, this option allows such lists to be processed,
    albeit rendered as regular ordered lists.

    Compared to the Pandoc option by the same name, the implementation
    does not support currently list markers enclosed in parentheses.

`(-) strikeout`
:   Enable strike-through support for a text enclosed within double
    tildes, as in `~~deleted~~`.

`(-) subscript`
:   Enable superscript support. Superscripts may be written by surrounding
    the subscripted text by `~` characters, as in `2~10~`.

    The text thus marked may not contain spaces or newlines.
    If the subscripted text contains spaces, these spaces must be escaped
    with backslashes.

`(-) superscript`
:   Enable superscript support. Superscripts may be written by surrounding
    the superscripted text by `^` characters, as in `2^10^.

    The text thus marked may not contain spaces or newlines.
    If the superscripted text contains spaces, these spaces must be escaped
    with backslashes.

`(-) bracketed_spans`
:   When enabled, a bracketed sequence of inlines (as one would use to
    begin a link), is treated as a Span with attributes if it is
    followed immediately by attributes, e.g. `[text]{.class key=value}`.

`(-) fenced_divs`
:   Allow special fenced syntax for native Div blocks. A Div starts with a
    fence containing at least three consecutive colons plus some attributes.

    The Div ends with another line containing a string of at least
    three consecutive colons. The fenced Div should be separated by blank
    lines from preceding and following blocks.

    Current implementation restrictions and differences with the Pandoc
    option by the same name: fenced Divs cannot be nested, the attributes
    cannot be followed by another optional string of consecutive colons,
    attributes have to be in curly braces (and cannot be a single unbraced
    word).

`(-) raw_attribute`
:   When enabled, inline code and fenced code blocks with a special kind
    of attribute will be parsed as raw content with the designated format,
    e.g. `{=format}`. Writers may pass relevant raw content to the
    target formatter.

    To use a raw attribute with fenced code blocks, `fenced_code_blocks`
    must be enabled.

    As opposed to the Pandoc option going by the same name, raw
    attributes can be continued with key=value pairs.

    How these constructs are honored depends on the writer. In the
    minimal case, they are ignored, as if they were stripped from
    the input.

`(-) fenced_code_attributes`
:   Allow attaching attributes to fenced code blocks, if the latter.
    are enabled.

    Current implementation restrictions and differences with the Pandoc
    option by the same name: attributes can only be set on fenced
    code blocks.

`(-) link_attributes`
:   Allow attaching attributes to direct images.

    Current implementation restrictions and differences with the Pandoc
    option by the same name: attributes cannot be set on links
    and indirect images (i.e. only direct images support them).

`(-) pipe_tables`
:   Support "Pipe Table", as with Pandoc's option by the same name,
    following the syntax introduced in PHP Markdown Extra.

`(-) table_captions`
:   Enable the Pandoc `table_captions` syntax extension for
    tables.

`(-) header_attributes`
:   Headings can be assigned attributes at the end of the line containing
    the heading text.

# TEMPLATES

By default, lunamark will produce a fragment.  If the
`--standalone` or `--template` options are specified, it will insert
this fragment into a template, producing a standalone document with
appropriate header and footer.  `--standalone` uses the default template
built into the writer, while `--template` specifies a custom template,
which is sought first in the working directory, then in
`templates`, and finally in `$HOME/lunamark/templates`. If no
extension is given, the name of the writer will be used as an
extension. So, for example, one can put the template `letter.html`
in the `$HOME?lunamark/templates` directory, and use it anywhere
with `lunamark --template letter`.

The templates are [cosmo](http://cosmo.luaforge.net/) templates.
Conditionals are enabled, so you can use the `$if` keyword
as follows:

    $if{ #people == 1 }[[There is only one.]][[There are many.]]

A `sepby` keyword is also enabled:

    $sepby{ people }[[$it]][[ and ]]

will render "`Sid`" if `people == {"Sid"}` and
"`Sid and Nancy`" if `people == {"Sid","Nancy"}`.

The following variables are set by default; others may be set
by the reader (if metadata extensions are used) or through
the `--data` option:

`body`
:   the fragment converted from markdown
`sources`
:   array of the source files specified on the command line
`timestamp`
:   the current time

# EXAMPLES

    lunamark

acts as a filter, reading markdown from stdin and writing
HTML to stdout.

    lunamark -Xsmart,definition_lists -t latex

acts as a filter, reading markdown with smart typography
and definition list extensions from stdin, and writing
LaTeX to stdout.

    lunamark -t latex -s -o mybook.tex ch{1,2,3}.txt references.txt

reads `ch1.txt`, `ch2.txt`, `ch3.txt`, and `references.txt`,
concatenates them, and converts the result from markdown to LaTeX,
using the default template and saving the result as `mybook.tex`.

    lunamark -Xall --template letter -d cc=Smith,cc="Jim Jones",sign="yes" \
      -t context -o myletter.ctx myletter.txt

produces a ConTeXt file using the template `letter.context`,
and setting the variable `cc` to `{"Smith","Jim Jones"}`
and `sign` to `"yes"`.  All lunamark etensions are enabled.

# ENVIRONMENT

The environment variable `LUNAMARK_EXTENSIONS` can contain
a comma-separated list of extensions, optionally prefixed by
`+` or `-`, that will serve as defaults. These defaults can
be overridden using the command-line option `--extensions`.

# AUTHORS

Most of lunamark is written by John MacFarlane.  Hans Hagen
made some major performance improvements to the markdown
parser.  Khaled Hosny added the original ConTeXt writer.

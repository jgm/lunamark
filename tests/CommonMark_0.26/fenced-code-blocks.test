<<<
Here is a simple example with backticks:

```
<
 >
```

With tildes:

~~~
<
 >
~~~

The closing code fence must use the same character as the opening fence:

```
aaa
~~~
```

~~~
aaa
```
~~~

The closing code fence must be at least as long as the opening fence:

````
aaa
```
``````

~~~~
aaa
~~~
~~~~

Unclosed code blocks are closed by the end of the document (or the enclosing block quote or list item):

> ```
> aaa

bbb

A code block can have all empty lines as its content:

```

  
```

A code block can be empty:

```
```

Fences can be indented. If the opening fence is indented, content lines will have equivalent opening indentation removed, if present:
 ```
 aaa
aaa
```

  ```
aaa
  aaa
aaa
  ```

   ```
   aaa
    aaa
  aaa
   ```

Four spaces indentation produces an indented code block:

    ```
    aaa
    ```

Closing fences may be indented by 0-3 spaces, and their indentation need not match that of the opening fence:

```
aaa
  ```

   ```
aaa
  ```

This is not a closing fence, because it is indented 4 spaces:

```
aaa
    ```
```

Code fences (opening and closing) cannot contain internal spaces:

``` ```
aaa

```
aaa
``` ```
```
~~~~~~
aaa
~~~ ~~
~~~~~~

Fenced code blocks can interrupt paragraphs, and can be followed directly by paragraphs, without a blank line between:

foo
```
bar
```
baz

Other blocks can also occur before and after fenced code blocks without an intervening blank line:

foo
---
~~~
bar
~~~
# baz

An info string can be provided after the opening code fence. Opening and closing spaces will be stripped, and the first word, prefixed with language-, is used as the value for the class attribute of the code element within the enclosing pre element.

```ruby
def foo(x)
  return 3
end
```

~~~~    ruby startline=3 $%@#$
def foo(x)
  return 3
end

Info strings for backtick code blocks cannot contain backticks:

``` aa ```
foo

Closing code fences cannot have info strings:

```
``` aaa
```

Unclosed code blocks are closed by the end of the document (or the enclosing block quote or list item):

`````
